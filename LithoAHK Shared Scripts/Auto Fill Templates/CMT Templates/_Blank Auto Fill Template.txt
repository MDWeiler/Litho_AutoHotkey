|     Reminders:
|	1) The file extention has to be AFT to be included in the UI
|	2) Missing\empty lines will be skipped
|	3) Use [BLANK] for blank lines you want to type
|       4) Text within two | (Pipes) is ignored
|	5) Special Tags - Optional
|		| End of Line Sequence | - Default is {enter}
|			This will be the keys pressed at the end of every line
|		| Use Paste Function | - Default is FALSE
|			Paste text insted of sending text
|		| EOL Pause | - Default is None or 0
|			This is the pause in milliseconds at the end of each line AFTER the End of Line Sequence is executed
|		| Key Pause | - Default is "Default" and will use current AutoHotkey Default SetKeyDelay setting (10ms)
|			This is the pause in milliseconds between key presses
|		| Mouse Pause |  - Default is "Default" and will use current AutoHotkey Default SetMouseDelay setting (10)
|			This is the pause between mouse movements and clicks - Larger numbers slow the mouse movement

|	6) Variables need to be enclosed in %s (example: %Scanner%) and they are NOT case sensitive
|	7) If you want to use the % sign it needs a ` before it (example: 100`%) 
|	8) Lines cannot containg a single character, if you need to send a single character start the line with a space - The space will be ignored and just the character will be sent
