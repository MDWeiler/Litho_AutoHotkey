# The Ignore Code uses Linux style files paths
#    You will need to replace \ with /

# Ignore Visual Studio Code generate files
/.vscode
*.code-workspace

# Local History for Visual Studio Code
.history/

# Built Visual Studio Code Extensions
*.vsix

# Ignore the Following Directories
#      Snapshot - A copy of all files within the project directory
#      Resource Files - These are notes and other miscellaneous files related to the project
/Snapshot
/Resource Files

# Ignore the Index.html file
*Index.html

# If you need to ignore a file that is already being tracked use the following:
# git rm --cached -r -f .
# This will reset the files being tracked
# git add . will add them all back except those now being ignored

# The plan is to use the local git repository as my active LithoAHK
